* External Risks

All world currencies today are controlled by sovereign nation states. This control has significant political and economic benefits and is, of course, zealously protected. As a result, attempts to create competing and  independent digital currencies, have quickly come under legal, or sometimes extra-legal, attack. Without a central organization, clearinghouse or controlling authority, bitcoin is not easy to attack. It is resilient to interference because control of the network and security of the currency is distributed as much as possible.
