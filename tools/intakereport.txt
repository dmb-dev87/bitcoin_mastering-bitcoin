=========

** Figs: Illustrations [ FILL IN: has posted the figs / is still working on the figs]. 
   75 total. (0 are informal; 0 are inline.)

   Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo

** Intake Report:
   (Git repo) tools/intakereport.txt

** MS Snapshot:
    To view the submitted files, you'll need to checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' 
    by running the following command in your checkout:
    
    $ git checkout manuscript_to_prod
    
    This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag 
    was created. 
    To switch the files back to the current state, run:
    
    $ git checkout master
  
  
Notes from Tools:
=================

** PROD: Add any authors to project that need to be added.
** Syntax highlighting: applied to [ FILL IN ] out of [ FILL IN ] code listings.
** During figure renaming, I didn't see any file named something like "images/blockchainwithforks.png," which is called at line 920 in ch10.asciidoc.
** Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.
